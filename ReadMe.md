# Idea
- Study low latency, high performance code(minimal avg runtime)
- Rt/AMP
- Tech for interraction rt and non-rt

# Cases

Case0:
Sigle core - one rt thread + interrupt
Q: ISR -> RT thread how?

Case1:
Single core + two rt thread with preority + 2 IRQ
Q: How to do it without locks? How to wait?

Read audion rt in linux

Case: rt thread take buffers from pool(hoofs), fill with noize and send (rt-way) to another thread
Q: how to measure latency?
Q: how to check, that code is minimal (no copy, no alloc, etc)
